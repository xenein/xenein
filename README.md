ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xenein

ğŸ‘€ I like to fiddle around in Python. If you want to annoy your ISP, your lawmakers or your government at large, I might be involved in projectsÂ helping you to do so. 

ğŸŒ± It'd be nice if I'd get around learning more about cryptography, implementing and verifying security.
